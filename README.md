# 👋 Hi, I'm Alex Conroy

I'm a data scientist and operating model designer with a background in analytics, engineering, and consulting — currently working at the intersection of machine learning, decision support, and responsible data.

I’ve completed a Master of Data Analytics at QUT and worked across the education, defence, and consulting sectors. I enjoy working on end-to-end data projects, from cleaning and exploration through to modelling, dashboards, and deployment.

## 🛠️ Currently Working On

### 🧩 Agentic PDF-to-Text Converter for Accessibility  
Building a layout-preserving, AI-assisted PDF converter that transforms complex academic material—including mathematical content, diagrams, and tables—into accessible formats for visually impaired students.  
**Tech Focus:** layout-aware segmentation · math parsing · multimodal content structuring · modular agent-based workflows  
**Learning Focus:** LangChain/OpenAI Agents · PDF layout modeling · Assistive UX pipelines · Math OCR and accessibility standards


### 🐟 Billy Bass AI Voice Interface (Edge AI Prototype)  
Developing an AI-powered, voice-interactive version of Billy Big Mouth Bass using on-device TinyML and a cloud-optional voice synthesis pipeline. This project explores multimodal AI interface design, natural language control, and real-time audio response on low-power hardware.  
**Tech Focus:** TinyML · Edge AI · Audio I/O · Embedded Python (Arduino)  
**Learning Focus:** Speech-to-AI agent flows · Audio synthesis · Cloud/offline agent design · On-device performance constraints


### 🏫 Australian Education Data Dashboard  
Creating an open-source dashboard that maps school catchments, feeder networks, and educational outcomes across Australia. Designed for policymakers, parents, and planners to better understand geographic and demographic impacts on access and performance.  
**Tech Focus:** Geospatial analytics · Dashboarding · Public data pipelines  
**Learning Focus:** Interactive insight design · Streamlit/Dash · Data storytelling for public-sector decision support


## 🔎 Exploring Next

I'm beginning to explore the intersection of **AI, data security, and edge-device intelligence** — with a long-term goal of contributing to responsible, privacy-preserving AI infrastructure.

**Key areas of learning:**
- Secure AI workflows and architecture  
- Lightweight on-device inference (TinyML, edge AI)  
- Multi-modal input (image, voice, video)  
- Unified API design and enterprise security considerations  
- Data compliance and safeguards for intelligent assistants

This aligns with a future interest in contributing to early-stage data products that serve regulated sectors like healthcare, defence, or finance.
