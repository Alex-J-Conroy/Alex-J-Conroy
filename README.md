# 👋 Hi, I'm Alex Conroy

I'm a data scientist and operating model designer with a background in analytics, engineering, and consulting — currently working at the intersection of machine learning, decision support, and responsible data.

I’ve completed a Master of Data Analytics at QUT and worked across the education, defence, and consulting sectors. I enjoy working on end-to-end data projects, from cleaning and exploration through to modelling, dashboards, and deployment.

## 🛠️ Currently Working On

**🧩 Agentic PDF-to-Text Converter for Accessibility**

I'm currently developing a layout-preserving, agent-based PDF converter that can:
- Extract and restructure math-heavy, image-rich documents  
- Support visually impaired students through accessible formats  
- Use layout-aware segmentation and lightweight task agents  

**🔍 Learning Focus:**
- Advanced PDF parsing and layout modeling  
- Agentic task chaining (OpenAI / LangChain Agents)  
- Modular AI pipelines  
- Clean UX for technical assistive tooling

## 🔎 Exploring Next

I'm beginning to explore the intersection of **AI, data security, and edge-device intelligence** — with a long-term goal of contributing to responsible, privacy-preserving AI infrastructure.

**Key areas of learning:**
- Secure AI workflows and architecture  
- Lightweight on-device inference (TinyML, edge AI)  
- Multi-modal input (image, voice, video)  
- Unified API design and enterprise security considerations  
- Data compliance and safeguards for intelligent assistants

This aligns with a future interest in contributing to early-stage data products that serve regulated sectors like healthcare, defence, or finance.
